# An Introduction to AHT Solutions, LLC  

## and the application of our FBHX Technology to Brine Concentrator Systems 

Today, the Oil & Gas Industry is faced with an exceptional opportunity to pursue **Energy Independence** in conjunction with the pursuit of an untapped and abundant **supply of water**.    AHT Solutions, LLC is determined to locate an adequately funded Partner to **team-up** with on a **Path** to **Energy Independence** and convert that **Path** to an **Expressway** for the abundant supply of both **Energy and Water**.

We **welcome** your interest in a technology that has the potential of turning brine disposal problems into environmentally sound **Water Resource Recovery Projects**.

**Our Breakthrough Technology** recovered a potable water resource from a West Texas drilling company’s exceptionally high salinity brine and the photo from recent Test & Demo Operations reveals its potential.  

 
**Brine Input** - to a Brine Disposal System (BDS) developed by AHT Solutions with over 170,000 mg/l (ppm) of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) is in Sample Jar #1 in the rear far left.  

 
**Concentrated Brine** - withdrawn from the system’s Brine Concentrator is shown in Sample Jar #2. It was estimated to have a total solids content (dissolved and suspended) of over 400,000 mg/l as suspended solids were seen in the sample and on the conductivity probe - while immediately upon sampling the conductivity meter was indicating over 360,000 mg/l TDS.  

 
**Brine & Settled Solids** are shown in Sample Jar #3 within less than 2 hours of sampling. The brine above the settled solids was reduced to about 120,000 mg/l TDS. Returning this brine to the Brine Concentrator could yield a potable water resource recovery in excess of 80%.  

 
**Product Water Output** - from the BDS is shown on the right in Sample Jar #4. With less than 100 mg/l (ppm) TDS this is a potable water resource that can be recovered from the most troublesome waste waters. Our BDS is ideally suited to handle waste waters with severe fouling and scaling tendencies that are totally incompatible with conventional heat exchangers and evaporator systems.  


We are currently seeking opportunities to convert **Waste Water Disposal Problems** into environmentally sound **Water Resource Recovery Projects**.  IF the conversion of a Problem to a Resource appeals to you, **please forward / share this introduction** with your like-minded Friends & Associates.
